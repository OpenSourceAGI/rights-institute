/**
 * Where the browser gets the Google client ID from.
 *
 * It has to arrive from somewhere at *runtime*: this app deploys to Cloudflare
 * Workers, where env vars are normally runtime vars/secrets (`wrangler secret
 * put`, or the Worker's dashboard) rather than values present in the build
 * environment. Three sources are tried, cheapest first:
 *
 *  1. `<script id="google-client-id" type="application/json">` — written by the
 *     root layout. Free when it's there, but the layout is prerendered on a
 *     statically-generated route, so on Workers it can be baked as `""` at
 *     build time. That is exactly why One Tap never appeared: the previous
 *     version read this tag once, at module-eval time, and gave up on `""`.
 *  2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, inlined at build time — the plain
 *     approach, for deployments that do have the value when they build.
 *  3. `GET /api/client-config`, a dynamic route that reads the Worker's
 *     runtime env. Always correct, costs one request, and is only reached when
 *     the two free sources came up empty.
 *
 * The client ID is public — it ships in every Google sign-in URL — so serving
 * it from an endpoint discloses nothing. The *secret* never leaves the server.
