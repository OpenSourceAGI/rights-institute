# Changelog

# MVP Phase (2026)

## June 2026

Build system modernization with migration from **@opennextjs/cloudflare** to **Vinext** for Cloudflare deployment. Enhanced **Vite** configuration with corrected alias resolution order so specific `@/lib` and `@/components` paths resolve before the bare `@` alias. Migrated **Tailwind CSS** configuration to CommonJS with a dedicated PostCSS config and removed unused **Turbopack** settings. Integrated the **Inter font** family with CSS support for multiple languages and improved layout typography. Added database schema and **Drizzle** migrations for messages, chats, and user management, with lazy loading of the database client and dynamic exports in route files. Enhanced the `build:cf` script to generate `worker.js` for **Cloudflare Workers**, updated **pnpm workspace** build flags, and added a documentation link to the README.

## May 2026

Deployment and authentication overhaul. Migrated to **OpenNext** for **Cloudflare Workers** deployment with `wrangler.jsonc` configuration and fixed an infinite build loop by separating the Next.js build from the OpenNext build. Integrated **Resend** for magic-link authentication and refactored **Google One Tap** sign-in, resolving build failures from a duplicated GoogleOneTap render. Added an interactive **globe visualization** component, **InvestorCard** and **InvestorList** components for investor profile data, and session management utilities. Reorganized homepage document navigation into categories and appended a **CAUSE framework** summary to the Understandings page. Migrated brand icons from **lucide-react** to **react-icons**, moved **PROSPER** contract files into a dedicated `prosper-coin` directory, removed legacy static documentation artifacts, and synced lockfiles to resolve peer dependency mismatches.

## March 2026

Smart contract foundations. Implemented the **PROSPER token** and revenue-sharing smart contracts with updated frontend components to match. Added an **auto-merge GitHub workflow** for CI automation and expanded project documentation. Refactored the TimelineMain component import path and fixed type errors.

## February 2026

Mobile responsiveness pass. Fixed mobile UI on the homepage and innovation timeline. Reorganized document navigation into five thematic sections (Legal Documents, Open Source Licensing, Startup Resources, Knowledge & Exploration) with section headers and descriptions. Made the timeline's search, tabs, cards, and typography fully responsive with a mobile-first **Tailwind** approach.

# Prototype Phase (2025)

## December 2025

Initial platform launch with core features. Implemented full authentication using **better-auth**: **Google OAuth** sign-in with callback handling, **magic link** login, and a dedicated login page — fixing session API 404s and the missing Drizzle verification model along the way. Built a custom document dashboard with templates (Contract, Terms, Ethics, PROSPER) and full CRUD API routes backed by a **Drizzle ORM** schema on **Turso**. Added a sortable **AG Grid** investor rankings table with pagination and custom cell renderers. Optimized the **Game of Life** animated background for lower CPU and memory usage. Simplified the UI by removing the header navigation bar in favor of a floating sign-in button and stripping heavy canvas text effects from the Problems and Understandings pages.
